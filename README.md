# pdf_merger
A GUI made with Tkinter, that allows the user to merge pdf and image files together to a pdf file.

# How to install:
1. download the python script and the requirements.txt file
2. if not done install python from: https://www.python.org/
3. In the folder where the requirements.txt file is located, open a terminal and install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. In the folder where the python script is located, open a terminal and start the app with:
```bash
python pdf_merger.py
```


# ToDo
- check linux compatibility
- FIX BUG: sometimes images seems to be cropped in the final pdf file
- add a checkbox, that decides wether or not the images converted to temporary pdfs should be stored or deleted after merging
